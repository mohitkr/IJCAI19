Mohit: thanks for pointing out this error, indeed it should be ($P_{11} +
P_{21}, P_{12} + P_{22}$), we will fix this.

Mohit: In the section ``Dealing with Ugly Tensors'' we mentioned that we
manually generate constraints with ugly tensors, by which we meant that we are
not enumerating intelligently using general to specific search for checking the
satisfiability of constraints which have ugly tensors. The proposed algorithm
still considers all the constraints with ugly tensors, the only thing that
changes is that the presence of ugly tensors increase the time taken to search
the whole constraint space. Although this does not impact much as the frequency
of ugly tensors appearing in a problem is quite low as is quite evident from
Table 2, which shows that most of the benchmark problems had no ugly tensors.
We included these tensors in our algorithm to be able to handle the rare cases
of them being appearing in a problem. All our experiments in the paper included
enumeration through the constraint space including ugly tensors.

Mohit: we understand that comparing our algorithm with related works can make
our case more strong, there are two reasons for not doing it:
